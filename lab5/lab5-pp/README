make clean: will remove all executables to get a clean start.

make will produce 4 executables:

1. serial (serial optimized -- SO in the report)
2. parallel (parallel optimized -- PO in the report)
3. sernopt (serial non optimized -- SN in the report).
3. parnopt (parallel non optimized -- PN in the report).


To run serial or parallel the command line is

./serial  <matrix dimension> <blocksize> <0 for no output and 1 for output>.

or 
./parallel  <matrix dimension> <blocksize> <0 for no output and 1 for output>.

For example the commmand 

                       ./parallel  2048 128  1  

will multiply 2048 x 2048 matrices with blocksize = 128 4 posix threads.

alternatively you can use  command

                      (time ./parallel  2048 128  0) &>out

to do the same multiplication without outputs and with time stats.



Serial version can be run in the same way. 

To run the non-optimized serial or parallel version the same command is used except that block size must be passed as some positive number such as 1. So, 
./serial  2048 1  1 will run serial and produce output.
